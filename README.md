ü§ñ Basic ML Projects 2

A collection of beginner-friendly machine learning projects focused on real-world applications like fraud detection, movie genre classification, and customer churn prediction.
üé¨ Movie Genre Classification

Create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual description.

    Techniques used:

        Text Vectorization (TF-IDF / Word Embeddings)

        Classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines

        Text preprocessing and feature extraction

üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using structured data.

  Dataset: Kaggle - [Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) 


    Techniques used:

        Data preprocessing and balancing (to handle imbalanced datasets)

        Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests

        Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
