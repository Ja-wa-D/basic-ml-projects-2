ðŸŽ¯ Basic ML Projects

This repository contains simple machine learning projects that focus on fundamental concepts and hands-on practice for beginners.
Currently, the repository includes:
ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions from a real-world credit card dataset using supervised learning techniques.

  Dataset: Kaggle - [Fraud Detection] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) 

    Techniques used:

        Data preprocessing

        Feature scaling

        Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest

        Evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Genre Classification

A simple machine learning model that classifies movies into their respective genres based on their features.

    Focus areas:

        Data cleaning and preprocessing

        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Model building using classifiers

        Genre prediction using text-based or feature-based inputs
